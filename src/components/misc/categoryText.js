	'combined' : ['The EEI represents the overall health of entrepreneurial ecosystems. The EEI is a composite index based on sub-indicators - Fluidity, Density and Diversity - and calculated using various U.S. Economic Census datasets. These sub-indicators are measures of ecosystem health, including population flux, sector variance, worker churn, immigration, and equality of opportunity. In the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Atlas, every metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the United States is given an EEI score, and subsequently ranked. Click on the sub-indicator or on the MSAs for further in-depth analysis.'], 

	'density' : ['At the core of any entrepreneurial ecosystem are the entrepreneurs themselves. Density is a measure of the rate entrepreneurs form new firms. The density metric does not measure pure volume, instead it ranks the relative density of new firms and the percentage of the workforce employed by these young firms.','The Density metric is comprised of three measurements: New and young firms per 1k population, share of employment in new and young firms, and high-tech sector density.'],

	'fluidity': ['Fluidity is a measure of the health of an entrepreneurial ecosystems that shows how metropolitan areas re-sort, adapt, and react. The fluidity metric measures population growth, population flux, and worker churn. Taken together these measures show the health of worker reallocation which can improve the quality of matches between workers and jobs and is an important element to regional growth. Barriers to worker reallocation can drag down a region’s entrepreneurial vibrancy. '],

	'diversity': [
				 'A vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem requires diversity of economy and population. It is important that all parts of the population are engaged in the economy and social mobility is one of the drivers of multi-level engagement.  As such one measure of a diverse entrepreneurial ecosystem is the equality of opportunity which is measured here as cross generational income growth based on parent’s income.',
				 'Healthy ecosystems also attract and assimilate immigrants. Immigrants are historically highly entrepreneurial, starting businesses at a high rate.',
				 'The diversity metric is comprised of two measures: immigration, and income mobility.  An ecosystem that is diverse in these ways tends to be robust and multi-leveled.'
